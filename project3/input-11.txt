In this file, we have some lines that are longer than 75 characters, but this time
I tried to make sure some words fall right across the 75-character limit, so we
won't be able to check those words.

You can see the difference here.  When th or s show up somewhere in the middle of a
line, we can spellcheck them, since "th" and "s" aren't legal words.  However when
we just see part of a word at the end of a line, we don't spellcheck that.
Maybe the extra characters that got chopped of at the end of the word would have
made it a legal word.   Who's to say?
