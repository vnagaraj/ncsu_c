The program is supposed to be able to handle lines of up to 75 characters. If
a line is longer than that, it will just show the first 75 characters, then it will
put ellipses at the end, to show that there was more of the line that it
wasn't able to show.

I'm trying to write this example so that it has a few lines longer than 75 characters,
but no word gets broken by this 75-character limit.  For a word like that, we
pretend we can't spellcheck it (since we don't save the whole word).
